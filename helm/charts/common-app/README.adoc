A simple reusable chart to deploy both applications.
Can be used when apps are homogenous like a set of Spring Boot microservices.


This can also be combined with umbrella chart pattern
by using alias property in umbrella chart's dependencies:

```
dependencies:
  - name: common-app
    version: 0.1.0
    repository: ../common-app
    alias: song-app # <------
  - name: common-app
    version: 0.1.0
    repository: ../common-app
    alias: haiku-app
```
