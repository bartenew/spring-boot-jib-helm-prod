First autumn morning
the mirror I stare into
shows my fathers face.

Your haiku is bad.
You are not a true poet.
Please stop today.

Aura of angels
Venus sews seeds of sunrise
Old as yesterday

Top of the mountain
At the valley the clouds float
By a calm river

Emu bush flowers
Cat watches attentively
For a hummingbird
