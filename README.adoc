Example of Spring Boot multi module project with Jib and Helm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Building Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`./mvnw package` will build an image for each child module with tag 1.0.0-${COMMIT-SHA}

Change `<goal>dockerBuild</goal>` to `<goal>build</goal>` to push images to your registry.

Deploying Apps with Helm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This project is using a single common chart for both apps. You can deploy each app by just overriding values inside
the chart like show in `helm/haiku-values.yaml`

*Quick Deploy*

Run `install-haiku.sh` to install a Helm release with Haiku App pod.
Follow instructions from Helm output to access your app in the browser.
