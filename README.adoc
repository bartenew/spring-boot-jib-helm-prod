Maven/Gradle example of Spring Boot multi module project with
Jib plugin and Helm. Demonstrates CI build of docker images
and how they can be deployed to k8s using Helm.

Building Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Maven*

`./mvnw compile jib:build` will build an image for each child module with tag 1.0.0-${COMMIT-SHA}

*Gradle*

`./gradlew jib` will build an image for each child module with tag 1.0.0-${COMMIT-SHA}

Deploying Apps with Helm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project is using a single common chart for both apps. You can deploy each app by just overriding values inside
the chart like show in `helm/haiku-values.yaml`

*Quick Deploy*

Run `install-haiku.sh` to install a Helm release with Haiku App pod.
Follow instructions from Helm output to access your app in the browser.
